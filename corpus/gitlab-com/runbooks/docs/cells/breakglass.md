# Breakglass

We follow the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege) whereby SREs don't have default read/write access to Cells infrastructure.  This helps limit blast radius in case of security
incidents or misconfigurations of running scripts locally to production.

# AWS

For AWS-deployed infrastructure, access is managed through Okta SSO using [Identity Center] for the Web Console and CLI.

## Web Console access

1. Go to <https://gitlab.okta.com/>
1. Click the **AWS Cells `<env>` Org** tile of your choosing (you can bookmark the result URL for future use)
    1. `<env>` can be either `Dev` or `Prod`
1. In the AWS access portal, open **Hub Cells`<env>`** and click **AdministratorAccess**
1. This will log you into the Hub account with an assumed Administrator role
1. On the top right of the AWS console, click the `username @ account-id` dropdown and click on `Switch role`[^1]
    1. ![img](./img/cells-gui-access-switch-role.png)
1. In the displayed form, enter account ID as the value of the `/aws_account_id` field from the tenant model of the Cell.
    1. _Example:_ `373633008521` for [cell c01k21yz9qqajjfn6z]
    1. **Note:** The value of the `/amp_aws_account_id` field should _not_ be used when switching roles.
    1. ![img](./img/cells-switch-role-form.png)
1. Enter `IAM role name` as either `dedicated/GitLabTenantAdminOperatorRole` or `dedicated/runner/GitLabRunnerAdminOperatorRole`
1. After switching roles, select the appropriate region (usually, `us-east-1`) to view the resources inside a Cell's account

## CLI access

The following process is the Cells version of the process for GitLab Dedicated which is outlined in [this guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/incident-management/-/blob/main/runbooks/break-glass.md#cli).

> [!warning]
> This flow grants AWS-account-level break-glass access only, not kubectl access.
> The AWS-account break-glass role (`AWSReservedSSO_GitLabTenantAdminOperator_<suffix>`) is not mapped into the tenant EKS cluster's Kubernetes auth.
> Running `aws eks update-kubeconfig` after the CLI break-glass will succeed locally, but any subsequent `kubectl` command will
> fail with `the server has asked for the client to provide credentials` on cellsdev and cellsprod.
> This is a known consequence of the Identity Center SSO migration.
> For `kubectl`, use the operator-shell method described in [Kubernetes Cluster Access](#kubernetes-cluster-access) below.

1. **Login to Hub account:** - Run `assume-env-local.sh` in the [AMP project]. `AMP_ENVIRONMENT` can be either `cellsdev` or `cellsprod`

   ```bash
   AMP_ENVIRONMENT=<environment>; eval "$(./scripts/assume-env-local.sh "${AMP_ENVIRONMENT}")"
   ```

   This will open a prompt in the browser to sign-in using SSO, select `Confirm and continue` and then `Allow access`.

2. **Assume role:** Run `assume-tenant-admin-operator.sh` to assume `dedicated/GitLabTenantAdminOperatorRole` IAM role in the target tenant account

   ```bash
   eval $(./scripts/assume-tenant-admin-operator.sh <TENANT_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>)
   ```

   `TENANT_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` is the value of the `/aws_account_id` tenant model field. _Example:_ `373633008521` for [cell c01k21yz9qqajjfn6z]

   > [!note]
   > Do not use the value of the `/amp_aws_account_id` field in the tenant model. (For [cell c01k21yz9qqajjfn6z], `amp_aws_account_id` field's value is `537566696576`)

1. **Confirm AWS access:** Run `aws sts get-caller-identity` to confirm that you have the right user and role ARN

    ``` shell
    $ aws sts get-caller-identity
    {
        "UserId": "<AWS_USER_ID>:OperatorAccess",
        "Account": "<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_GitLabTenantAdminOperator_<suffix>/OperatorAccess"
    }
    ```

    > [!note]
    > On legacy non-SSO environments, the ARN instead shows `assumed-role/GitLabTenantAdminOperatorRole/OperatorAccess`.

### Operator shell setup

Both `Kubernetes Cluster Access` and `Terraform access` below require an [Instrumentor operator shell][connecting-to-aws].
Run these two steps first from a local clone of the [Amp project]:

1. **Export the tenant model** from a local Tissue clone:

   ```bash
   export TENANT_MODEL="$(cat <tissue>/rings/cells<dev|prod>/<ring>/<tenant_id>.json)"
   ```

2. **Launch an operator shell** using [`amp-operator-access.sh`][amp-operator-access.sh]:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/amp-operator-access.sh -e cells<dev|prod> -s <STAGE>
   ```

   Replace `<STAGE>` with `configure` for Kubernetes access, or with the target stage for Terraform access.

### Kubernetes Cluster Access

To run `kubectl` against a tenant's EKS cluster, complete the [operator shell setup](#operator-shell-setup) above with `-s configure`, then run the following inside the shell.
This authenticates as `configuration_ansible@<tenant_id>`, which the tenant cluster grants RBAC to.

1. **Configure kubectl for the tenant cluster:**

   ```bash
   eval "$(tenctl configure -m "$TENANT_MODEL" env)"
   ```

   > [!note]
   > If you launched the shell with `amp-operator-access.sh -s provision` instead, use
   > `eval "$(tenctl provision -m "$TENANT_MODEL" --generate-kubeconfig env)"`
   > (the `--generate-kubeconfig` flag is required for the `provision` stage; `configure` generates the kubeconfig unconditionally).
   > Either stage yields working `kubectl` - you only need one.

2. **Use kubectl:**

   ```bash
   kubectl -n default get pods

   # Rails console:
   kubectl -n default exec -it deployments/gitlab-toolbox -- gitlab-rails console
   ```

   > [!note]
   > Always supply `-n <namespace>` explicitly.
   > Do not rely on the kubeconfig default namespace, which is inherited from the operator shell pod environment (`switchboard-<env>` or `shells`), not the tenant cluster.

For full detail on the operator shell, see the [amp scripts README][amp-scripts-readme] and [`amp-operator-access.sh`][amp-operator-access.sh].

### Terraform access

Use the [Instrumentor operator shell][connecting-to-aws] to run Terraform against a Cell's stage infrastructure for approved operational changes or Terraform state surgery.
Prefer Tissue/IaC pipelines for routine changes.
The full stand-up sequence is `prepare → onboard → provision → configure` (see [Instrumentor stages][instrumentor-stages]).
Each stage has a specific Terraform root.

| Stage              | Terraform root                   | Tenant kubeconfig           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `prepare`          | `aws/prepare`                    | Not generated               |
| `onboard`          | `aws/onboard`                    | Not generated               |
| `provision`        | `aws/provision`                  | Use `--generate-kubeconfig` |
| `configure`        | `aws/configure/<CONFIGURE_ROOT>` | Generated automatically.    |
| \\_ `pre_ansible`  | `aws/configure/pre_ansible`      |                             |
| \\_ `post_ansible` | `aws/configure/post_ansible`     |                             |
| \\_ `failsafe`     | `aws/configure/failsafe`         |                             |

Do not run stages concurrently for the same Cell.

Complete the [operator shell setup](#operator-shell-setup) above with the target stage, then run the following inside the shell:

1. **Initialize the stage environment and run Terraform:**

   For `prepare`, `onboard`, or `provision`:

   ```bash
   eval "$(tenctl <STAGE> -m "$TENANT_MODEL" env -s bash)"

   cd "/home/instrumentor/aws/<STAGE>"

   terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config="$INSTRUMENTOR_TF_BACKEND_CONFIG"
   terraform state list
   terraform plan -lock=false
   ```

   For `configure`, replace `<CONFIGURE_ROOT>` with `pre_ansible`, `post_ansible`, or `failsafe`:

   ```bash
   eval "$(tenctl configure -m "$TENANT_MODEL" env -s bash)"

   env | grep '^INSTRUMENTOR_TF_'               # confirm what is exported

   TF_ROOT="$INSTRUMENTOR_TF_ROOT_MODULE_POST"  # or ..._PRE / or ..._FAILSAFE

   terraform -chdir="$TF_ROOT" init -backend-config="$INSTRUMENTOR_TF_BACKEND_CONFIG"
   terraform -chdir="$TF_ROOT" state list
   terraform -chdir="$TF_ROOT" plan -lock=false
   ```

   > [!note]
   > Use `-lock=false` for `terraform plan` to avoid taking a state lock during investigation.

**Safety rules:**

- Start with `terraform state list` and `terraform plan -lock=false`. Review planned changes before applying.
- Require an approved operational change record before running `apply`, destructive Terraform actions, or stage teardown.
- Do not run `onboard`, `provision`, or `configure` concurrently for the same tenant. Terraform locking does not prevent every cross-stage race.
- Do not use the direct AWS Identity Center break-glass role when you need tenant Kubernetes authentication; use the [operator shell][connecting-to-aws] instead.

# GCP

We use [Privileged Access Manager (PAM)][PAM] to provide short lived access to GCP via the console or `gcloud`.

## How to escalate

Google provides guides to request access through [the console](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-request-temporary-elevated-access#request-grant-console)
and through the [`gcloud` CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-request-temporary-elevated-access#request_a_grant_programmatically).

Specific Examples:

- [`org_read`](#org_read)
- [`project_read`](#project_read)
- [`project_admin`](#project_admin)
- [`project_breakglass`](#project_breakglass)
- [amp](#amp)

## Levels of access

### Default Access

By default we give [enough permissions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/tissue/-/blob/702095d2f62f7fc65c3171f87e410432c308987f/terraform/modules/cell-environment/iam.tf) to SREs to view the organization, view projects, and use PAM. For any further action through GCP changes must be made
through IaC or using PAM escalation.

|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![cells dev overview](./img/cells_dev_org_switcher.png) | ![cells_production_overview](./img/cells_prod_org_switcher.png) |

### Org-wide Access

#### [org_read](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/library/terraform/google-privileged-access-manager/-/blob/346edc2e8c2ecee79b8bf06a23819675d4be644d/predefined-entitlements.tf#L9-L28)

- Get access with `gcloud`:

    ```sh
    # $ORG_ID for dev: `425712905585`
    # $ORG_ID for prod: `1073525295030`
    # $CELL_ENV for dev: `dev`
    # $CELL_ENV for prod: `prod`
    gcloud beta pam grants create \
              --entitlement="org-readonly-entitlement-${CELL_ENV}" \
              --requested-duration="1800s" \
              --justification="$ISSUE_LINK" \
              --location=global \
              --organization="$ORG_ID"
    ```

- Get access with console: [dev](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?organizationId=425712905585) | [prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?organizationId=1073525295030)

This entitlement provides the ability to `list` resources at an org-wide level, but does not provide the ability to `get` details for resources, other than IAM bindings. This is useful for initial
discovery and exploration of the resources available across the org.

### Project Access

#### [project_read](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/library/terraform/google-privileged-access-manager/-/blob/346edc2e8c2ecee79b8bf06a23819675d4be644d/predefined-entitlements.tf#L30-L53)

- Get access with `gcloud`:

    ```sh
    # TENANT_ID: Can be found in the "tenant_id" field in the tenant model in `cells/tissue`.
    # example TENANT_ID="c01j2gdw0zfdafxr6"
    gcloud beta pam grants create \
              --entitlement="gldt-readonly-entitlement-${TENANT_ID}" \
              --requested-duration="1800s" \
              --justification="$ISSUE_LINK" \
              --location=global \
              --project="cell-${TENANT_ID}"
    ```

- Get access with console: [dev](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=cell-c01j2t2v563b55mswz) | [prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=cell-c01j2gdw0zfdafxr6)

This entitlement provides the ability to view resources within a project scope. This allows you to `list` and `get` resources to discover and describe specific resource configurations, e.g. Viewing
the details for a GKE cluster and its nodes.

#### [project_admin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/library/terraform/google-privileged-access-manager/-/blob/346edc2e8c2ecee79b8bf06a23819675d4be644d/predefined-entitlements.tf#L55-L110)

- Get access with `gcloud`:

    ```sh
    # TENANT_ID: Can be found in the "tenant_id" field in the tenant model in `cells/tissue`.
    # example TENANT_ID="c01j2gdw0zfdafxr6"
    gcloud beta pam grants create \
              --entitlement="gldt-admin-entitlement-${TENANT_ID}" \
              --requested-duration="1800s" \
              --justification="$ISSUE_LINK" \
              --location=global \
              --project="cell-${TENANT_ID}"
    ```

- Get access with console: [dev](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=cell-c01j2t2v563b55mswz) | [prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=cell-c01j2gdw0zfdafxr6)

Admin access provides typical operational readwrite abilities for managing cell infrastructure.

This level of access requires an approver, and typically will also link to an issue detailing why the access is required.
We should prefer making changes through IaC wherever possible.

> [!note]
> This entitlement requires approval from a member of the `gcp-ops-sg@gitlab.com` Google group.
> **Who can approve**: Any SRE or Infrastructure Manager in this group.
> **Next steps**: Please ask a team member to approve your PAM request.

#### [project_breakglass](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/library/terraform/google-privileged-access-manager/-/blob/346edc2e8c2ecee79b8bf06a23819675d4be644d/predefined-entitlements.tf#L55-L110)

- Get access with `gcloud` access:

    ```sh
    # TENANT_ID: Can be found in the "tenant_id" field in the tenant model in `cells/tissue`.
    # example TENANT_ID="c01j2gdw0zfdafxr6"
    gcloud beta pam grants create \
              --entitlement="gldt-breakglass-entitlement-${TENANT_ID}" \
              --requested-duration="1800s" \
              --justification="$ISSUE_LINK" \
              --location=global \
              --project="cell-${TENANT_ID}"
    ```

- Get access with console: [dev](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=cell-c01j2t2v563b55mswz) | [prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=cell-c01j2gdw0zfdafxr6)

Breakglass provides the same level of access as the [`project_admin`](#project_admin) entitlement.

This access does not require an approver. The entitlement is intended to be used
during an incident response when there is low team member availability.

We should use `breakglass` as a last resort when we need to make an emergency change to speed up incident response.

#### Amp

- Get access with `gcloud`

    ```sh
    # AMP_PROJECT_ID for dev: `amp-b6f1`
    # AMP_PROJECT_ID for prod: `amp-3c0d`
    gcloud beta pam grants create \
                    --entitlement="gld-readonly-entitlement" \
                    --requested-duration="1800s" \
                    --justification="$ISSUE_LINK" \
                    --location=global \
                    --project="amp-3c0d"
    ```

- Get access with console: [dev](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=amp-b6f1) | [prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/pam/entitlements/my?project=amp-3c0d)

The AMP GCP project has the same entitlements as a Cell, meaning [`project_read`](#project_read), [`proejct_admin`](#project_admin), [`project_breakglass`](#project_breakglass)

### Kubernetes Cluster Access

If you would like to connect to the GKE cluster inside the Cell using `kubectl` on your local machine, you can do so by getting the GKE cluster credentials for the Cell.

> [!note]
> This will work only **after** you have completed requesting access through [PAM] and your request has been approved.

```bash
TENANT_ID="<tenant_id>"

gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${TENANT_ID} \
  --region us-east1 \
  --project cell-${TENANT_ID}
```

# Troubleshooting

## Cluster Not Running Warning

If you see a warning that the cluster is not running, when you attempt to get the cluster credentials for a Kubernetes cluster:

```
WARNING: cluster c01j98xncnbxvaqayp is not RUNNING. The kubernetes API may or may not be available.
```

This may indicate the cluster is being upgraded or in maintenance.
Check the cluster status in the GCP/AWS console or try again some time later.
