## Summary

Secret Revocation (`secret-revocation`) is a Runway-based workload/deployment that is a part of the [Secret Revocation Service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service).

It runs the service in the API (default) mode, and serves a number of [API endpoints](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service#api) that are used by the [monolith](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) to inform partner APIs of leaked tokens to revoke. When a token is received, the appropriate handler is identified, and message is created and published to the corresponding [Google PubSub topic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service#pubsub_topic), which are then picked up the [Worker workload](../secret-revc-worker/README.md) to send the actual revocation requests to partner APIs.

This service is currently used by ["Automatic Response to Leaked Secrets"](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/automatic_response/) feature, and is maintained by the AST:Secret Detection team.

The source code repository for both services (API and Worker) is available [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service) and the runway deployment configuration are located in:

* [`secret-revc-worker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service/-/tree/main/.runway/secret-revc-worker)
* [`secret-revocation`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service/-/tree/main/.runway/secret-revocation)

## Architecture

Check the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/automatic_response/#high-level-architecture) for a high-level architecture.

More details about the end-to-end workflow can also be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service#workflow).

<!-- ## Performance -->

## Scalability

This service is deployed using Runway and its scaling is handled by Cloud Run and configured as part of Runway deployment (see [documentation](https://docs.runway.gitlab.com/runtimes/cloud-run/scalability/)).

## Availability

Both workloads are [publicly accessible](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service#public-availability) because each require some [external interaction](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/secret-detection/secret-revocation-service#external-interactions) whether ingress or egress. They're deployed in `us-east1` region.

<!-- ## Security/Compliance -->

## Monitoring/Alerting

The service is deployed using Runway and Runway packs built-in observability, particularly [monitoring stack](https://docs.runway.gitlab.com/reference/observability/). Default Runway metrics for the service is available at [Runway Service Metrics dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/runway-service/runway3a-runway-service-metrics).
