# Orbit NATS server SLO alerts

Covers `OrbitServiceNatsServerErrorSLOViolation`, `OrbitServiceNatsServerTrafficCessation`
and `OrbitServiceNatsServerTrafficAbsent`.

## Overview

NATS is the message broker between Siphon, the dispatcher and the indexers. This SLI
watches core NATS message flow.

These alerts are severity s3 and do not page. The SLI is tagged `platform_insights`,
which has no SLO-alert Slack routing in `services/teams.yml`, so these alerts go to the
default alert feed rather than a team channel. Disk saturation has its own paging alert
(`nats_disk_space`, s2), with its runbook at
[docs/nats/operations.md](../../nats/operations.md).

## Services

- [Orbit service overview](../README.md)
- [NATS runbook](../../nats/README.md)
- SLI owner team: `platform_insights` (the Siphon/DIP platform team, also behind the
  NATS cluster). The Orbit indexers consuming NATS are owned by `context_systems`.

## Alerts

### OrbitServiceNatsServerErrorSLOViolation

Slow consumers are rising. A slow consumer is a client that cannot keep up with the
messages NATS is sending it; NATS drops it after a buffer limit.

### OrbitServiceNatsServerTrafficCessation / TrafficAbsent

No messages are flowing at all. Either the producers stopped (dispatcher, Siphon) or
the cluster itself is unhealthy. `TrafficCessation` means traffic recently dropped to
zero, `TrafficAbsent` means it has been missing for longer.

## Metrics

The `nats_server` SLI in
[`metrics-catalog/services/orbit.jsonnet`](../../../metrics-catalog/services/orbit.jsonnet)
uses the NATS varz metrics (message in-rate, slow consumer count) from the Prometheus
exporter sidecar.

Slow consumers should be zero in normal operation. Any sustained non-zero rate means a
consumer is undersized or stuck.

## Alert Behavior

- Silence via [Alertmanager](https://alerts.gitlab.net/#/alerts?filter=%7Btype%3D%22orbit%22%7D)
  filtered on the alertname.
- Slow consumers usually track indexer health: an underscaled or crashing indexer pool
  shows up here before anywhere else.

## Severities

- s3, no paging. User impact is indexing delay (stale data), queries are unaffected.

## Verification

The alerts fire on these recording rules in the `mimir-analytics-eventsdot` datasource
([Grafana Explore](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/explore)):

```promql
# Error ratio
gitlab_component_errors:ratio_1h{type="orbit", component="nats_server", monitor="global"}

# Request rate (traffic cessation fires when this drops to zero)
gitlab_component_ops:rate_1h{type="orbit", component="nats_server", monitor="global"}
```

  consumers, JetStream state.
- Cluster state: `kubectl --context gke_gl-orbit-prd_us-east1_orbit-prd -n nats get statefulset,pod,pvc`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slow consumers rising, indexer pods restarting | Indexer pool unhealthy or undersized | Fix or scale the indexers, not NATS. See [indexer SDLC](gkg-indexer-sdlc.md) / [indexer code](gkg-indexer-code.md) pages |
| Traffic ceased, NATS pods healthy | Producers stopped: dispatcher down or Siphon CDC dry | See the [dispatcher page](gkg-dispatcher.md) and the [Siphon dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/orbit-orbit-siphon) |
| NATS pod down, cluster degraded | Node or PVC problem | Standard kube triage; JetStream replicates within the cluster, consumers reconnect |
| Disk usage growing | Lagging consumers accumulate persisted stream data | Scale the indexers. For emergency disk mitigation see [docs/nats/operations.md](../../nats/operations.md) |

## Possible Resolutions

- Scale or fix the consuming indexer pools; NATS itself rarely needs scaling
  (see [NATS](../README.md#nats)).
- mTLS certificate problems surface as connection errors on Orbit pods; certificates are
  cert-manager issued, check their age and events.

## Dependencies

- Producers: Siphon CDC, the dispatcher. Consumers: the indexer pools. If NATS is fully
  down, all indexing stops and NATS KV (locks and progress) is unavailable, so
  `graph-status` degrades. See [What degrades if X fails](../README.md#what-degrades-if-x-fails).

## Escalation

- Ask in `#g_analytics_platform_insights` (`platform_insights`, owns the NATS layer) or
  `#f_orbit_dev` (`context_systems`, owns the Orbit consumers).
- Generic SLO playbooks: [ErrorSLOViolation](../../alerts/ErrorSLOViolation.md),
  [TrafficAbsent](../../alerts/TrafficAbsent.md).

## Definitions

- [Alert rules](../../../mimir-rules/analytics-eventsdot/orbit/autogenerated-analytics-eventsdot-orbit-service-level-alerts.yml)
  (generated, do not edit).
- [Tune the SLI](../../../metrics-catalog/services/orbit.jsonnet), then run `make generate`.
