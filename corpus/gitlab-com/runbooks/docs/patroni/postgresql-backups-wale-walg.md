# PostgreSQL Backups: WAL-G

## WAL-G Overview and its ancestor, WAL-E

Here the link to the video of the [runbook
simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqAeOblI4NM&feature=youtu.be).

[WAL-E][WAL-E] was designed by Heroku to solve their PostgreSQL backup issues.
It is a Python-based application that is invoked by the PostgreSQL process via
the 'archive_command' as part of PostgreSQLs [continuous
archiving][PSQL_Archiving] setup.

It works by taking [Write-Ahead Logging][PSQL_WAL] files, compressing them, and
then archiving them off to a storage target in near realtime. On a nightly
schedule, WAL-E also pushes a full backup to the storage target, referred to as
a 'base backup'. A restore then is a combination of a 'base backup' and all of
the WAL transaction files since the backup to recover the database to a given
point in time.

[WAL-G](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g) is [the successor of
WAL-E](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/08/18/introducing-wal-g-faster-restores-for-postgres/)
with a number of key differences. WAL-G uses LZ4, LZMA, or Brotli compression,
multiple processors, and non-exclusive base backups for Postgres. It is backward
compatible with WAL-E: it is possible to restore from a WAL-E backup using
WAL-G, but not vice versa.

Currently (September 2021), the main backup tool for GitLab.com is WAL-G, we fully
migrated to using it from WAL-E.

## Very Quick Intro: 5 Main Commands

Backups consists of two parts:

- periodical (daily) "full" backups (a.k.a "base backups" executed by the
  `wal-g backup-push` command), and
- constant shipping of completed WAL files to GCS to enable Point-in-time
  recovery (PITR) (executed by the `wal-g wal-push` command - configured
  as postgresql `archive_command`).

To restore to a given point of time or to the latest available point, a full
backup and a sequence of WALs are needed. To reduce the size of such a sequence,
full backups can be performed more frequently. On the other hand, creation of
full backups is a very IO-intensive operation, so it doesn't make sense to do it
very often. Currently, for the GitLab.com database, full backups are created
daily.

WAL-G has 5 main commands:

| Command | Purpose | How it is executed | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `backup-list` | Get the list of full backups currently stored in the archive | Manually | It is helpful to see if there are "gaps" (missing full backups).<br/> Also, based on displayed LSNs, we can calculate the amount of WALs generated per day.<br/> Notice, there is no "wal-list" - this command would print too much information so it would be hard to use it, so neither WAL-E nor WAL-G implement it. The backups in this list are ordered by the timestamp they were last modified on the filesystem. So if a backup gets moved to nearline storage after a certain time, it is wrongly shown as the newest! With `backup-list --detail --pretty` we get start and finish times and the backups are ordered correctly. |
| `backup-push` | Create a full backup: archive PostgreSQL data directory fully | Manually or automatically | Daily execution is configured in a cron record (see `crontab -l` under `gitlab-psql`, it has an entry running the script `/opt/wal-g/bin/backup.sh`, writing logs to `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log[.1]`).<br/> At the moment, it is executed daily (at 00:00 UTC) on one of the secondaries (chosen using a lock in Consul), using WAL-G.<br/> This operation is very IO-intensive, the expected speed: ~0.5-1 TiB/h for WAL-G, 1-2 TiB/h for WAL-G. |
| `wal-push` | Archive WALs. Each WAL is 16 MiB by default | Automatically (`archive_command`) | This command is usually used in `archive_command` (PostgreSQL configuration parameter) and automatically executed<br/> by PostgreSQL on the primary node. As of June 2020, ~1.5-2 TiB of WAL files is archived each working day<br/> (less on holidays and weekends). |
| <nobr>`backup-fetch`</nobr> | Restore PostgreSQL data directory from a full backup | Manually | Is it to executed manually a fresh restore from backups is needed. Also used in "gitlab-restore" for daily verification of backups<br/> (see <https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/-/blob/master/bootstrap.sh>). |
| `wal-fetch` | Get a WAL from the archive | Automatically<br/> (`restore_command`; not used on `patroni-XX` nodes) | It is to be used in `restore_command` (see `recovery.conf` in the case of PostgreSQL 11 or older, and `postgresql.conf` for PostgreSQL 12+).<br/> Postgres automatically uses it to fetch and replay a stream of WALs on replicas.<br/> As of June 2020, `restore_command` is NOT configured on production and staging instances - we use only streaming replication there. However, in the future, it may change.<br/> Two "special" replicas, "archive" and "delayed", do not use streaming replication - instead, they rely on fetching WALs from the archive, therefore, they have `wal-fetch` present in `restore_command`. |

## Backing Our Data Up

### Where is Our Data Going

The data gets pushed using WAL-G to Google Cloud Storage into a bucket.
All servers of an environment (like `gprd`) push their WAL to the same bucket
location. This is because, in the event of a failover, all the servers should
have the same backup location to streamline both backups and restores. With
WAL-G, we use one of replica daily to create a full backup (`wal-g backup-push`)
but we archives WALs (`wal-g wal-push` from the primary for better PRO.
Some replicas retrieve WALs from the bucket for archive
recovery (per configured `restore_command` in Postgres).

All GCS buckets are multi-reginal storage in the US location.

| environment | bucket |
| --- | --- |
| gprd | <https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gitlab-gprd-postgres-backup> |
| gstg | <https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gitlab-gstg-postgres-backup> |
| prdsub | <https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gitlab-prdsub-postgres-backup> |
| stgsub | <https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gitlab-stgsub-postgres-backup> |
| sentry | <https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/gitlab-secondarydb-backups?region=us-east-1&prefix=sentry/&showversions=false> |

### Interval and Retention

We currently take a basebackup each day at 0 am UTC and continuously stream WAL
data to GCS. As of September 2021, the daily backup process performed by WAL-G takes
~9 hours with Postgres cluster size ~14 TiB.

Backups are kept for 7 days, moved to the Coldling storage class after 7 days, and deleted after 90 days by a lifecycle rule on GCS (check [the production documentation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/production/#backup-and-restore) for changes).

### How Does it Get There?

#### Production

##### Daily basebackup

- `gprd`/`gstg`:
  [`gitlab-walg`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-walg) cookbook
  installs WAL-G and a cron job to run every day.

    ```shell
    $ ssh patroni-v12-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal -- 'sudo -u gitlab-psql crontab -l'
    # Chef Name: full wal-g backup
    0 0 * * * /opt/wal-g/bin/backup.sh >> /var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log 2>&1
    ```

- `prdsub`/`stgsub`:
  [walg](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customersdot-ansible/-/blob/74856576703c8caad8e354bdffce9d70665cea7f/roles/walg/tasks/main.yml)
  ansible role installs WAL-G and a cron job to run every day.

  ```shell
  $ ssh customers-01-inf-prdsub.c.gitlab-subscriptions-prod.internal -- 'sudo -u postgres crontab -l'
  #Ansible: Database backup: wal-g backup-push
  0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-g backup-push /var/lib/postgresql/10/main >> /var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log 2>&1
  ```

##### Archiving WALs

WAL files are sent via PostgreSQL's `archive_command` parameter, which looks
something like the following:

```cron
archive_command = /opt/wal-g/bin/archive-walg.sh %p
```

### How Do I Verify This?

 You can always check the GCS storage bucket and see the contents of the  basebackup and WAL archive folders.

Alternatively, you can check the results of continuous WAL archiving and daily full backup creation manually on servers:

#### How to check WAL archiving

See `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g.log` on primary:

#### Checklist of reconfiguration / WAL-G upgrades

After upgrades or reconfiguration check:

1. Check that WAL-G binary is working and shows the expected version:

    ```shell
    cd /tmp
    sudo -u gitlab-psql /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /opt/wal-g/bin/wal-g --version
    ```

1. Check the logs (as described above):
    - WAL archiving (check this on the primary)

        ```shel
       sudo tail /var/log/wal-g/wal-g.log
        ```

    - full backup creation (check all replicas or only that one where you know that `backup-push` is happening

        ```shel
        sudo tail /var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log.1
        ```

1. Once a new full backup is created, check the list of full backups available:

    ```shell
    sudo -u gitlab-psql /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /opt/wal-g/bin/wal-g backup-list
    ```

    (Important note: the output shows modification timestamps. In WAL-G versions prior 1.1, the list was ordered by modification time; since 1.1 it's ordered by creation time, which is important for our case, when we automatically move older backups to the Nearline storage class)
1. After 1-2 days, check that verification jobs ("gitlab-restore" project) are not failing.

## Restoring Data

### Oh Sh*t, I Need to Get It BACK

Before we start, take a deep breath and don't panic.

**TODO: update to WAL-G**

#### Production

Consider using the delayed replica to speed up PITR. The full database backup
restore is also automated in a [CI
pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd), which may be helpful
depending on the type of disaster. To restore from WAL-E backups, either WAL-G
or WAL-E can be used. In "gitlab-restore", the default is WAL-G, as it gives 3-4
times better restoration speed than WAL-E. Use `WAL_E_OR_WAL_G` CI variable to
switch to WAL-E if needed (just set this variable to `wal-e`). For the
  "basebackup" phase of the restore process, on an `n1-standard-16` instance,
  the expected speed of filling the PGDATA directory is 0.5-1 TiB per hour for
  WAL-E and 1.5-2 TiB per hour for WAL-G.

Below we describe the restore process step by step for the case of WAL-E (old
procedure). For WAL-G, it is very similar, with a couple of nuances. For
details, please see
<https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/-/blob/master/bootstrap.sh>.

In order to restore, the following steps should be performed. It is assumed that
you have already set up the new server, and that server is configured with our
current chef configuration.

1. In the Chef role assigned to the node, add `recipe[gitlab-server::postgresql-standby]` to the runlist,
   apply the following attributes then converge Chef:

    ```json
    {
      "gitlab-server": {
        "postgresql-standby": {
          "postgres-conf-auto-rules": {
            "restore_command": "/usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /opt/wal-g/bin/wal-g wal-fetch \"%f\" \"%p\"",
            "recovery_target_timeline": "latest"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Log in to the `gitlab-psql` user (`su - gitlab-psql`)

1. Restore the base backup (run in a screen on tmux session and be ready to wait
   several hours):

    ```bash
    /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env /opt/wal-e/bin/wal-e backup-list
    PGHOST=/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/ PATH=/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin:/opt/gitlab/embedded/sbin:$PATH \
      /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env /opt/wal-e/bin/wal-e backup-fetch /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data <backup name from backup-list command>
    ```

    To restore latest backup you can use the following:

    ```bash
    /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env /opt/wal-e/bin/wal-e backup-list
    PGHOST=/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/ PATH=/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin:/opt/gitlab/embedded/sbin:$PATH /usr/bin/envdir \
      /etc/wal-e.d/env /opt/wal-e/bin/wal-e backup-fetch /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data LATEST
    ```

1. This command will output nothing if it is successful.

1. Optional: In case the database should only be recovered to a certain
   point-in-time, add [recovery target
   settings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-RECOVERY-TARGET)
   to `postgresql.auto.conf`.

1. Start PostgreSQL. This will begin the archive recovery. You can watch the
   progress in the postgres log.

1. IMPORTANT:
    - WAL-G won't stores the PostgreSQL configuration (postgresql.conf,
      postgresql.auto.conf). You need to take care about
      configuration separately.
    - As of June 2020, `restore_command` is not used on `patroni-XX` nodes.
      Therefore, if your restoration is happening as a part of DR, you need to
      consider removing `restore_command` in the very end.
    - If this is your new master (again, if it is DR actions), then you need to
      promote it (using `/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/trigger` or `pg_ctl
      promote`), and adjust configuration (`archive_command`,
      `restore_command`).

## Troubleshooting

**NB: the document below is slightly outdated, refering WAL-E, but in general, WAL-E instructions are relevalt to WAL-G**
**TODO: update it**

### How to Check if WAL-G Backups are Running

#### Daily backups ("base backups" or "wal-g_backup_push")

WAL-G `/opt/wal-g/bin/backup.sh` script is running on all machines in the patroni cluster. However, the "base backups" actually runs only in the **first Replica that aquires a Consul lock** for the job execution.

You can check WAL-G `backup-push` in several ways:

1. Metric (injected via prometheus push-gateway from the backup script):
[gitlab_com:last_walg_successful_basebackup_age_in_hours](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1d&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=gitlab_com%3Alast_walg_successful_basebackup_age_in_hours&g0.tab=0)
1. using Kibana (not valid while wal-g logs are not yet shipped to Elastic Search): <!-- TODO: implement redirect of wal-g output to syslog similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production-engineering/-/issues/10499 -->

- [`log.gprd.gitlab.net`](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net)
- index: `pubsub-system-inf-gprd`
- document field: `json.ident` with value `wal_g.worker.upload`

1. by logging directly into the VM:

- ssh to the patroni master
- logs are located in `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log`, the file is
    under rotation, so check also `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log.1`, etc

As WAL-G `backup-push` only executes in one of the replicas, you should observe the following logs:

`backup-push` on the Primary: example of log entries on the primary

```
<DATE> backup.sh: I'm the primary. Will not run backup.
```

`backup-push` on the Replica that executed the backup (only the fist replica that starts the backup should execute it):

```
<DATE> backup.sh: start backup <LABEL> ...
...
<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> Selecting the latest backup as the base for the current delta backup...
<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> Calling pg_start_backup()

<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> Calling pg_stop_backup()
<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> Starting part ??? ...
<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> backup_label
<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> tablespace_map
<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> Finished writing part ???.
<DATE> backup.sh: INFO: <DATE> Wrote backup with name base_???
<DATE> backup.sh: end backup <LABEL>.
```

`backup-push` on the Replica that did not executed the backup:

```
<DATE> backup.sh: start backup ??? ...
<DATE> backup.sh: Shutdown triggered or timeout during lock acquisition
<DATE> backup.sh: Could not acquire walg-basebackup-patroni lock. Will not run backup.
```

#### Continuous Shipping of WAL Files ("wal-push")

As described in the previous chapter, the base backups are taken in one of the replicas, however, the WAL (transaction log files) are continuously generated and shiped into the cloud storage from the Primary node (only node accepting writes).

In order to find out which machine is the primary, go to the [relevant Grafana dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/000000244/postgresql-replication-overview?orgId=1) or execute `sudo gitlab-patronictl list` on one of the nodes.

WAL-G `wal-push` works by uploading WAL files to a GCS bucket whenever a wal file is completed (which happens every few seconds in gprd). The wal-g `wal-push` command is configured as postgresql `archive_command` and run by a PostgreSQL [background worker](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/bgworker.html). The worker can run custom code, in our case, it's running the WAL-G `/opt/wal-g/bin/wal-g wal-push` binary. The background worker is a process that is forked from the main postgres process. In case of WAL-G `wal-push` it lives only a few seconds.

Any relevant information will be logged into `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g.log` file, including pushed files and errors.
> *See more at:* [How to check WAL archiving](#how-to-check-wal-archiving)

In the PostgreSQL logs we found just the errors of the `archive_command`, and you can check them with the following:

```
grep "wal-g" /var/log/gitlab/postgresql/postgresql.csv
```

For each failed attempt to archive a wal file, there would be an entry like the following:

```
"archive command failed with exit code 1","The failed archive command was: /opt/wal-g/bin/archive-walg.sh pg_wal/<file_name>"
```

### Continuous Shipping of WAL Files (wal-push) is not working

Metric (via mtail): [gitlab_com:last_walg_backup_age_in_seconds
metric](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=2h&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.expr=gitlab_com%3Alast_walg_backup_age_in_seconds&g0.tab=0)

*Attention*: If WAL shipping (`archive_command`) fails for some reason, WAL
files will be kept on the server until the disk is running full! [Check disk available space of Prod Patroni servers](https://thanos.gitlab.net/graph?g0.expr=node_filesystem_avail_bytes%7Benv%3D%22gprd%22%2Ctype%3D%22patroni%22%2Cmountpoint%3D%22%2Fvar%2Fopt%2Fgitlab%22%2Cshard%3D%22default%22%7D&g0.tab=0&g0.stacked=0&g0.range_input=2w&g0.max_source_resolution=0s&g0.deduplicate=1&g0.partial_response=0&g0.store_matches=%5B%5D)

#### WAL-G `wal-push` process stuck

If you're not seeing logs for successfull `wal-push` uploads (e.g. nothing
writes to the log file or there are only entries with `state=begin` but not with
`state=complete`) then there's something wrong with WAL-E.

##### Check the WAL-E's `wal-push` upload process

Run `ps` a few times (the upload process is short-lived so you might not catch
it the first time), example output:

```
# ps aux | grep 'wal-push'
gitlab-+ 29632  0.0  0.0   4500   844 ?        S    12:16   0:00 sh -c /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env /opt/wal-e/bin/wal-e wal-push pg_xlog/0000001D00014F6B000000A2
gitlab-+ 29633 35.0  0.0 124200 41488 ?        D    12:16   0:00 /opt/wal-e/bin/python /opt/wal-e/bin/wal-e wal-push pg_xlog/0000001D00014F6B000000A2
root     29638  0.0  0.0  12940   920 pts/0    S+   12:16   0:00 grep wal-push
```

If the timestamp on the WAL-E process is relatively long time in the past (e.g.
15 mins, 1h) then that's a hint that it's stuck at uploading files.

Check the state of the process with: `strace -p <pid>` . If the process is
stuck, `strace` will show no activity.

Another indicator of a stuck process is the timestamp on the latest file
uploaded to GCS, i.e. it will be close to the timestamp on the upload process.
`gsutil` might take too long to list files in the bucket, so go to the [web
UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gitlab-gprd-postgres-backup/)
and start typing in the prefix of the filename last uploaded (don't type in the
full name).

If everything points to the fact that WAL-E upload process is stuck, consider
killing it. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL! After killing the process it should be
restarted automatically and the backups should resume immediately.

##### Other

If `wal-push` is not working, it will probably be something related with the
network or GCS.

PostgreSQL is configured to archive with WAL-E upon some conditions, as
specified via Chef:

```
    gitlab_rb:
      postgresql:
        archive_command:              /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env /opt/wal-e/bin/wal-e wal-push %p
```

### WAL-E `wal-push` is working (but I still got paged)

The problem might be `mtail`.

1. Check `mtail` is working with `sudo sv status mtail`
1. If `mtail` is up, check `/var/log/mtail` for errors under `/var/log/mtail.ERROR`.
1. You might want to restart `mtail` if it's stuck with `sudo sv restart mtail`.

### Regular basebackup has failed

1. Check the logs in `/var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log` (and possibly
   rotated files).
1. If the error looks to be a transient GCS error, you can retry the backup in a
   tmux with:

   ```
   sudo su - gitlab-psql
   /opt/wal-g/bin/backup.sh >> /var/log/wal-g/wal-g_backup_push.log 2>&1
   ```

Transient object store errors should be retried once this PR lands in a wal-g
release that we consume: <https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/pull/833>.

## Database Backups Restore Testing

Backups restore testing is fully automated with GitLab CI pipelines, see
<https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore>.

1. [`postgres-gprd`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/-/pipeline_schedules): Backups of production GitLab.com backup are tested twice per day:
    1. Slightly after the time when `backup-push` is expected to be finished on
       the primary (at 11:30 a.m. UTC as of June 2020). This verifies the fresh
       full backup and small addition of WALs.
    1. Right after `backup-push` is invoked on the primary (at 00:05 a.m.).
       This allows to ensure that not only full backups are in a good state,
       but also WAL stream, all the WALs in the archive are OK, without gaps.
1. [`postgres-prdsub`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-prdsub/-/pipeline_schedules): Backups of produciton customers.GitLab.com are tested once per day
1. [`Dev`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/-/pipeline_schedules): Backups of dev.gitlab.org are tested once per day
1. [`Registry`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/-/pipeline_schedules): Backups of the registry database are tested once per day

When a backup is verified via the CI job, the job will send a notification to Dead Man's Snitch. If the job fails to check in after a specified number of times, Dead Man's Snitch will send a page.

### Troubleshooting: What to Do if Backup Restore Verification Fails

In the case of failing Postgres backup verification jobs, use the following to
troubleshoot:

1. In `gitlab-restore` find the pipeline that is subject to investigation and
   remember its ID.
1. First, look inside the pipeline's jobs output. Sometimes the instance even
   hasn't been provisioned – quite often due to hitting some quotas (such as
   number of vCPUs or IP addresses in "gitlab-restore" project). In this case,
   either clean up instances that are not needed anymore or increase the quotas
   in GCP.
1. In ["gitlab-restore" project at GCP
console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=gitlab-restore),
find an instance with the pipeline ID in instance name. SSH to it and check:
    - Disk space (`df -hT`). If we hit the disk space limit, it is time to
      increase the disk size again – usually, it's done in the [source code
      of the "gitlab-restore"
      project](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd),
      but it is also possible to configure CI/CD schedules to override it.
    - Recent logs (`sudo journalctl -f`, `sudo journalctl --since yesterday |
      less`). There might be some insights related to, say, WAL-E/WAL-G
      failures.
    - Postgres replica is working (`sudo gitlab-psql`). If you cannot connect,
      then either Postgres is not installed properly, or it hasn't reached the
      point when PGDATA can be considered consistent. If the replaying of WALs
      is still happening (see the logs), then it is worth waiting some time.
      Otherwise, the logs should be carefully investigated.
1. Finally, if none of above items revealed any issues, try performing
`backup-fetch` manually. For that:
    1. Run a new CI/CD pipeline in "gitlab-restore", using the CI variable
    values taking them from "Schedules" section (there is "Reveal" button
    there), and adding `NO_CLEANUP = 1` to preserve the instance.
    1. SSH to the instance after a few minutes, when it's up and running.
    1. Before proceeding, use WAL-E's (WAL-G's) `backup-list` to see the
    available backups. One of possible reasons of failure is lack of some daily
    basebackup. In such a case, you need to so to Postgres master node and
    analyze WAL-E (WAL-G) log (check `sudo -u postgres crontab -l`, it should
    show how daily basebackups are triggered and where the logs are located). If
    the list of backups looks right, continue troubleshooting.
    1. Wait until the issue repeats and backup verification fails (assuming it's
    permament – if not, we only can analyze the logs of the previous runs).
    1. Manually follow the steps from
    <https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/-/blob/master/bootstrap.sh>,
    starting from erasing PGDATA directory and proceedign to WAL-E's (WAL-G's)
    `backup-fetch` step which normally takes a few hours.
    1. Once `backup-fetch` is finished, you should have a Postgres "archive
    replica" – a Postgres instance that constantly pulls new WAL data from
    WAL-E (WAL-G) archive. Check it with `sudo gitlab-psql`. Note, that it is
    normal if you cannot connect during some period of time and see `FATAL: the
    database system is starting up` error: until recovery mode is reached a
    consistent point, Postgres performs REDO and doesn't allow connections. It
    may take some time (minutes, dozens of minutes), after which you should be
    able to connect and observe how the database state is constantly changing
    due to receving (via `wal-fetch`) and replaying new WALs. To see that, use
    either `select pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()` or `select now(),
    created_at, now() - created_at from issues order by id desc limit 1`.
    1. Troubleshoot any failures in place, checking the logs, free disk space
    and so on.
    1. Finally, once troubleshooting is done, do not forget to destroy the
    instance manually, it won't get destroyed automatically because of
    `NO_CLEANUP = 1` we have used!
