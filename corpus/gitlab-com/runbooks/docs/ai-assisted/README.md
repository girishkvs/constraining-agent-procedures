# AI-Assisted Service

## Summary

AI Assisted is a dedicated Rails fleet that provides an AI Abstraction Layer in front of [AI Gateway](../ai-gateway/README.md). It handles AI-specific requests that are often long running and depend on external services (such as Vertex AI and Anthropic). To prevent these requests from occupying Puma workers on the main fleet, potentially impacting performance, AI Assisted runs on an isolated fleet to safely serve these endpoints without affecting core GitLab traffic.

## Architecture

For diagram, refer to [architecture blueprint](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/ai_architecture/#saas-based-ai-abstraction-layer).

## Operational Roles and Responsibilities

Most traffic served by the AI Assisted service supports Code Suggestions features, such as Code Generation and Completion, which are owned by the [Code Creation Group](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ai/ai-coding/). If additional feature teams begin contributing endpoints in the future, service ownership may need to be reassessed.

Note that the fleet is **not** limited to `/api/v4/ai_assisted*`. HAProxy also routes the Duo Agent Platform WebSocket endpoint `/api/v4/ai/duo_workflows/ws` here, so the `gitlab_workhorse_duo_workflow_*` counters are emitted under `type="ai-assisted"` — see [duo-agent-platform](../duo-agent-platform/README.md).

The service is implemented across the following projects:

* [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com): Kubernetes deployments, services and ingress rules
* [gitlab-haproxy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-haproxy): HAProxy routing configuration and backend pools
* [Chef Repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo): Chef roles and backend IP configuration
* [gitlab-com/runbooks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks): Service catalog, metrics catalog, and monitoring configuration
