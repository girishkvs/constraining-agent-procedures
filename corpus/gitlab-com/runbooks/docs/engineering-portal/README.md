## Summary

Engineering Portal that provides a single pane of glass for a centralized software catalog with ownership and metadata.

> [!warning]
> **Not ready for `production` use.**

Engineering Portal is considered an [Experiment](https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/development_stages_support/#experiment). The purpose of adding PoC to runbooks during experimental status is to facilitate production readiness in the near future.

## Architecture

For architecture, refer to Engineering Portal PoC [documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/engineering-portal-poc/-/blob/main/README.md#architecture).

## Performance

N/A for Experimental PoC.

## Scalability

For scalability, refer to Runway [documentation](https://docs.runway.gitlab.com/runtimes/cloud-run/scalability/) and Runway [service manifest](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/engineering-portal-poc/-/tree/main/.runway).

## Availability

N/A for Experimental PoC.

## Durability

N/A for Experimental PoC.

## Security/Compliance

For security, refer to (in progress) InfraSec [lightweight review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/infrastructure-security/bau/-/issues/15463).

## Monitoring/Alerting
