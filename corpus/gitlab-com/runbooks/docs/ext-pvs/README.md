## Summary

External Pipeline Validation Service (`ext-pvs`), as the name suggests, is an **external** service that is configured into GitLab and its purpose is to validate CI Pipelines _before_ they are even started (via a web hook).

See <https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/cicd/external_pipeline_validation/> for the general case.

Readiness review is at <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/issues/17>. This review was done for the
_legacy_ (i.e., before migrating to Runway) External Pipeline Validation Service, however most of it still applies to
the service running in Runway as we're still using Cloud Run and it's mostly just a change in how the service is
deployed.

The actual external service for gitlab.com is provided and run by Trust & Safety (see <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/trust-and-safety/pipeline-validation-service>); this runbooks is largely targeted at operational matters for SREs responsible for .com.  For many *immediate* purposes we can treat it as a blackbox external service, although we do have some visibility/controls if we have to in an emergency.

Service deployments are managed by Runway.

## Environments

Runway deploys the service to both staging and production environments. When you trigger pipelines in
staging.gitlab.com, it would use the staging endpoint below, while any pipelines triggered in gitlab.com would use the
production endpoint below:

* Staging: <https://ext-pvs.internal.staging.runway.gitlab.net/validate>
* Production: <https://ext-pvs.internal.runway.gitlab.net/validate>

These endpoints are only accessible **internally** and **unidirectionally** _from_ their respective GitLab environments.

For example: the production PVS service is only accessible _from_ the `gprd` VPC in the `gitlab-production` project but
communication from the opposite direction is not permitted (i.e., you cannot connect to `gitlab-production` _from_ the
production PVS service).

### Deployments

Deployment of this service to staging and production are handled by Runway. See [documentation](https://runway-docs-4jdf82.runway.gitlab.net/).

## Status codes

The service responds to requests from .com at the `/validate` endpoint. As per the [spec](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/cicd/external_pipeline_validation/#usage), it replies with the following status codes:

* `200`: will cause .com to accept pipeline
* `406`: will cause .com to reject pipeline
* `500`: will cause .com to accept pipeline and log event

The service supports a read-only mode (enabled by setting the `PIPELINE_VALIDATION_MODE` environment variable to `read-only`). In this mode, the service will perform its usual logic and logging, but always return status code `200`, effectively becoming merely an observer.

## Failure modes

1. Service outage - in the case of a complete service outage, pipelines will default to authorized, which would result in abusive pipelines being executed, however it won't affect the running of any pipelines as it the service request will timeout after 1 second as per the `DEFAULT_VALIDATION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` configuration.
2. Overly permissive rule - in the case where an overly permissive rule is deployed abusive jobs would no longer be blocked in the same way. The rollout of changes will need to be monitored closely by the engineering teams in order to ensure rule changes are having the expected results.
3. Overly restrictive rule - in the case where an overly restrictive rule is deployed legitimate jobs would start to be blocked. This would be observed by an increase in the rate of pipeline validation failures. If this type of failure is observed, the first course of action would be to rollback the most recent rule change.

## Alerts

Runway provides alerts for Apdex and Error Rate SLO violations: <https://runway-docs-4jdf82.runway.gitlab.net/reference/observability/#alerts>

## Logging

Logs for this service are currently available via Stackdriver. You can use the Cloud Run UI or Logs Explorer to view the
logs:

* Staging: <https://cloudlogging.app.goo.gl/kPjmjYAWVhRXCNYt6>
* Production: <https://cloudlogging.app.goo.gl/uf2U9GJJvXG3kFki7>

There is an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/platform/runway/team/-/issues/84) tracking improvements to
the logging across all Runway services so that developers can access them in a more predictable and standard way.

The logs can be observed from both sides:

* PVS (logs from the service itself): <https://cloudlogging.app.goo.gl/Ji4fB2FPFTVxT6ab6>
* GitLab (logging the rejection): <https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/764d373889cb1d9f6fd6f7f93856198c>
* There is some duplication/repeat logging here, so raw counts may be misleading

The PVS logs are likely more immediately useful as they show *why* the job was rejected, but it may be helpful to correlate with what GitLab saw.

Useful attributes emitted to the PVS logs:

* `correlation_id`
* `mode` active or passive
* `failure_reason` reason for the failure if applicable
* `msg` additional details about the failure if applicable
* `rejection_hint` an indicator of the specific rule failure if applicable
* `status_code` status code returned to as part of the request (200, 406, or 500)
* `user_id` id of the user who created the pipeline
* `validation_status` pass or fail
* `validation_input` the full CI script input that triggered a validation failure

An example of logging that happens per request on the `/validate` endpoint:

```json
# Service request acknowledgement
{"correlation_id":"123","level":"info","mode":"active","msg":"received request","time":"2021-04-22T09:28:15+02:00"}
# Service request outcome
{"correlation_id":"123","failure_reason":"invalid_script","level":"warning","mode":"active","msg":"pipeline rejected due to invalid script string","pipeline_sha":"9459c735bdc2352b8169789e5cc61b2a382d6f25","project_id":35,"rejection_hint":"xmr","status_code":406,"time":"2021-04-22T09:28:15+02:00","user_id":37,"validation_status":"fail"}
# HTTP server generic response log entry

```

## Metrics

A basic metrics dashboard exists at <https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ext-pvs-main/ext-pvs-overview>

The primary observability metrics available today are Apdex, Error Rate, and RPS. These metrics can be used to observe any instability or unexpected change in the service utilization.

## Rules

For the initial version of the service a static set of rules are defined in the [rules.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/trust-and-safety/pipeline-validation-service/-/blob/master/rules/rules.yaml). These rules can be on a granular level to active or passive mode.

**NOTE: NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED** The next iteration (implemented in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/trust-and-safety/pipeline-validation-service/-/merge_requests/31>) will support granular control over the state of each rule. The rules are stored in a separate repository, which will be checked on a regular basis for new rules. When new or changed rules are found, they are loaded into the service and the configuration is updated.

## Control

### Emergency Disabling

In the event that this service is causing too many false positives (or some other large problem) and it needs to be
disabled, you need to update the application settings via the API (UI may be provided in future):

```sh
curl --request PUT --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $TOKEN" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/application/settings?external_pipeline_validation_service_url="
```

**NOTE**: Use an admin-level PAT for `$TOKEN`.

### Readonly vs Active

Active/read-only mode of the pipeline validation service gets set during the deployment. The mode is stored in an environment variable that gets forwarded to Cloud Run in `--set-env-var` parameter to `gcloud run deploy`. The variable name is `PIPELINE_VALIDATION_MODE` and it gets injected into a deployment build when it starts. It is defined in the secret variables page that can be accessed from the Pipeline Validation Service project -> Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables (expand).

In order to enable the `read-only` mode the contents of this secret variable needs to be exactly `read-only`. For active mode it can be set to `active` but a value that is not `read-only` will be considered to be `active` automatically.

After a change to `PIPELINE_VALIDATION_MODE` is made, a new deployment needs to be done to change the mode.

### GitLab Configuration

This feature is configured in GitLab using either environment variables or application settings, with the latter taking precedence.  In practice, we use application settings because they live in the database and are modifiable live with API calls (and perhaps a Web UI in future), without having to do full deployments/restarts across the fleet.

The settings are:

* external_pipeline_validation_service_url
* external_pipeline_validation_service_token
* external_pipeline_validation_service_timeout

The presence of a configured URL is sufficient for GitLab to start making the checks; therefore when (re-)enabling, ensure you have set the token (and probably timeout) first before setting the URL.

To set these options, obtain an admin-level Personal Access Token and run something like ```curl --request PUT --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $TOKEN" "http://gitlab.com/api/v4/application/settings?external_pipeline_validation_service_url=$VALUE"``` (the setting name varies in the obvious manner).

The token is optional; if provided it is passed to the external service in a header (`X-Gitlab-Token`), the alternative being a query parameter embedded in the URL.  We use the token/header functionality for the GitLab implementation of PVS so that it is unlikely to logged in any normal scenarios.

The values for the URL and Token are saved in 1Password, in the Engineering Vault in an item called `Pipeline Authorization Configuration`
