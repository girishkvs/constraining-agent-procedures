## Summary

Observer is a GitLab DX data collection service. It is the ingest path for the dashboards in [`dashboards/dx/`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/tree/master/dashboards/dx), which are ClickHouse-backed.

<!-- ## Architecture -->

## Architecture

Observer is a Ruby on Rails application deployed on [Runway](https://docs.runway.gitlab.com/) (Google Cloud Run, in the `gitlab-runway-production` GCP project).

## Service Management

Observer is fully managed from a single GitLab project: [`gitlab-org/quality/observer`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/observer).

Deployment is handled by [Runway](https://docs.runway.gitlab.com/):

* **Staging** deploys automatically from every push to `main` and runs in `dry-run` mode (no writes to production ClickHouse), allowing safe pre-production validation.
* **Production** deploys only on tag push pipelines. Tags are created by manually triggering the version-bump pipeline from the GitLab UI, which produces a new [Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/observer/-/releases) with a changelog.

Application secrets (including the webhook authentication token and ClickHouse credentials) are stored in Rails encrypted credentials (`config/credentials.yml.enc`). The decryption key is stored in the Runway app vault entry. See the [project README](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/observer/-/blob/main/README.md#credentials) for rotation instructions.
